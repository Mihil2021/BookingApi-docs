# Getting Started
Incoperating our extensive API into your pre-existing booking solution or workflow is as simple as download, setup and go. Our booking API provides the means to access all of our endpoints accessible via our API. We also provide a package to plug in the ApiClient via dependency injection so you can share your authentication details across the lifetime scope; instead of having to re-declare for each request.

## Requirements
- Newtonsoft.Json >= 12.0.3

## Installation

``` powershell
    Install-Package Norsk.BookingApi.Abstractions
```

``` powershell
    Install-Package Norsk.BookingApi.Core
```
